# Cleaning Nashville Housing Data with SQL

## Data Set Overview
The Nashville Housing Data contains information about properties in Nashville relating to its location, sale information, property value and number of bedrooms/baths.

## Methodology
1. Checking the data set for NULL values and replacing them where possible.
2. Removing duplicate rows from the data set.
3. Standardising the date format.
4. Reformatting some columns so that the information is easier to use.
5. Reformatting columns with inconsistent values.
